# FIFA2018DynamicVisualisation
A dynamic visualisation created using Processing (based on Java) to interactively display the best players of the FIFA World Cup.


This project must be run on Processing! 

Hover over players on the virtual field to highlight and select them
Hover over bars on the graph to bring up their z-scores (how many standard deviations away from the mean the player's performance is)
and actual scores.
The compare function allows users to compare two different graphs for the same position
